# Bug Fixes Report

This document details 3 bugs found and fixed in the codebase, including logic errors, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.

## Bug #1: Memory Leak in TravelSimulator Component

### Location
`src/components/world/TravelSimulator.tsx` (Line 295-305)

### Description
The component creates a `setInterval` timer during travel simulation but fails to clean it up when the component unmounts. This causes a memory leak and potential performance degradation over time, especially if users navigate away from the page while a simulation is running.

### Impact
- **Type**: Performance Issue / Memory Leak
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Users**: All users using the travel simulator feature
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Gradual memory consumption increase
  - Potential browser slowdown after extended use
  - Console warnings about state updates on unmounted components

### Root Cause
The interval timer was only cleared when the simulation reached 100% completion, but not when:
1. The component unmounts
2. A new simulation starts while another is in progress
3. The user navigates away from the page

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Added useRef to store interval reference
const simulationIntervalRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null)

// Clear any existing interval before starting new simulation
if (simulationIntervalRef.current) {
  clearInterval(simulationIntervalRef.current)
  simulationIntervalRef.current = null
}

// Store interval reference
simulationIntervalRef.current = setInterval(() => {
  // ... simulation logic
}, 100)

// Added cleanup effect
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (simulationIntervalRef.current) {
      clearInterval(simulationIntervalRef.current)
    }
  }
}, [])
```

## Bug #2: Prisma Client Production Configuration Issue

### Location
`src/lib/prisma.ts` (Lines 1-11)

### Description
The Prisma client initialization was not optimized for production environments. The current implementation could lead to connection pool exhaustion in serverless environments (like Vercel) and lacks proper logging configuration.

### Impact
- **Type**: Performance Issue / Scalability Issue
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Users**: All users in production environment
- **Symptoms**:
  - Database connection errors under load
  - "Too many connections" errors
  - Slow database queries without visibility into the cause

### Root Cause
1. No connection pool configuration for serverless environments
2. Missing logging configuration for different environments
3. Using deprecated `global` instead of `globalThis`

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Prevent multiple instances of Prisma Client in development
const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
  return new PrismaClient({
    log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error'],
  })
}

export const prisma = globalThis.prisma ?? prismaClientSingleton()

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  globalThis.prisma = prisma
}
```

### Additional Recommendations
For production deployment, consider adding connection pool configuration:
```typescript
datasourceUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
connection_limit: 2,
connect_timeout: 10,
```

## Bug #3: Missing Environment Variable Validation (Security Vulnerability)

### Location
`src/lib/auth/auth-options.ts` (Lines 49-50)

### Description
The Google OAuth provider configuration uses non-null assertion operator (`!`) on environment variables without validation. This causes the application to crash at runtime if these environment variables are not set, exposing error details to users.

### Impact
- **Type**: Security Vulnerability / Logic Error
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Users**: All users when Google OAuth is not properly configured
- **Symptoms**:
  - Application crashes with unhandled errors
  - Exposure of internal error messages
  - Complete authentication failure even for other providers

### Root Cause
Using non-null assertion (`!`) bypasses TypeScript's null checking without runtime validation, assuming environment variables will always be present.

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Validate required environment variables
const googleClientId = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
const googleClientSecret = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

// Only add Google provider if credentials are available
...(googleClientId && googleClientSecret ? [
  GoogleProvider({
    clientId: googleClientId,
    clientSecret: googleClientSecret,
    authorization: {
      params: {
        prompt: "consent",
        access_type: "offline",
        response_type: "code"
      }
    }
  })
] : [])
```

### Security Benefits
1. Graceful degradation - app continues to work with other auth providers
2. No exposure of internal errors to end users
3. Better configuration flexibility for different environments

## Summary

All three bugs have been identified and fixed:

1. **Memory Leak** - Fixed by properly managing interval lifecycle with useRef and cleanup effects
2. **Prisma Production Issues** - Fixed by implementing singleton pattern and environment-specific logging
3. **Security Vulnerability** - Fixed by adding proper environment variable validation and graceful fallbacks

These fixes improve the application's performance, reliability, and security posture significantly.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **For Bug #1**: Test navigation away from TravelSimulator during active simulation
2. **For Bug #2**: Load test the application to ensure connection pooling works correctly
3. **For Bug #3**: Test authentication flow with and without Google OAuth credentials set
